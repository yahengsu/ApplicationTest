# rYYCer - Community Ridesharing for Android


# What is it?
rYYcer (Ride YYC) is an Android ridesharing application focused on promoting local community goodwill and fostering community relations. Using the community boundary data from the Calgary Open Data Set, ridesharing is focused within each individual community. This allows for shorter wait times between rides, more commmunity interaction between community members, and an easy way to travel locally. 

# Features
- Ridesharing Board
- Localized Ridesharing using Calgary Open Data set
- User Authentication through Firebase API
- Location Services through Google Maps API

# How does it work?
Using the Calgary Open Data Set, ridesharing is confined within each individual community. That means that ridesharing in Edgemont will mainly be used by residents of Edgemont, while ridesharing in say Aspen Landing will mainly be used by residents of Aspen. Users post ride requests or offers on the ridesharing board, and from there other community members can accept rideshare requests or join in on a rideshare offer. Users can set their own rideshare compensation, or choose to offer a free ride.

# Future Considerations
- UI Update
- Rating System
- Schedule Frequent Rides Feature
- Favourite Drivers Feature
